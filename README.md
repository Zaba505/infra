# My Infrastructure as Code Monorepo

This repo contains all infrastructure as code (IaC), services, and documentation
for my personal home lab. To get a better understanding of all this, the [docs](https://zaba505.github.com/infra)
site is a perfect place to begin.

P.S. Yes, I know this is widely over-engineered.
